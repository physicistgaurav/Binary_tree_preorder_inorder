# Binary_tree_preorder_inorder
Starting with the best case, if preorder or inorder are empty , it first returns none, basically not creating a tree .And if it is not empty then,the first element in the preorder Traversal is the root node of the binary tree.We find the index of that root in inorder traversal. Every element before that index belongs to left subtree and to the right belongs to right subtree.Now we recursively create left and right subtree by passing new preorder and inorder subarray. For the left subtree we pass the preorder from index 1 to the index position of the root in the inorder array(which is given by root in our program) and the inorder array includes from the beginning upto root but not including the root.And to build the right subtree, preorder array from the position of root to the end of array and for the inorder also we pass the inorder array   from the root position to the end of the array as we want every node to the right of the root. This is a recursive process of passing the subarrays inorder to create a binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal. To check the correctness of our binary tree we have created BT.py which creates the inorder and preorder array which matches with our input inorder and preorder array, as shown in the output.
